## Group 4: Arm Based Implementation of Speech Controlled Wheelchair
### Introduction
Nowadays, keyword spotting and speech recognition are widely used in diferent application in order to improve the quality of human's life and solve inconvenience. Based on the our obseervation, we found that the increasing number of disabled and elderly people is leading to more invention in medical support devices. For example, the evolution of wheelchairs from the conventional mechanical wheelchair to nowadays electric wheelchair. However, some users were unable to freely control the wheelchair due to lack of arms or energy or having involuntary action people.
  
  Thus, this project proposed a user friendly speech controlled wheelchair to elderly and disabled groups. Users can voice out simple commands for controlling wheelchairâ€™s movement. Any forces not even is needed for the wheelchair operation. Throuhout the project, 4 simple commands which are "GO", "STOP", "Left" and  "Right" are trained using CNN in the DSP of STM32 in order to control the movement of the servo motor.

### Requirements
Below are the minimum hardware and software requiremnets for this project.
